Why an Open Guide?
------------------
Thousands of students study abroad in Buenos Aires each year. Yet, all they have to navigate when they get here are Google reviews, advice from friends that have gone before, and local recommendations.

It should be much easier to navigate the new city as an abroad student. Based on your interests, age and studies, you should automatically have a wide variety of activities and events to do. Otherwise, the abroad experience, while good, will contain significant wasted time going to less exciting locations to eat, club, hangout, and everything else.

As a student currently in Buenos Aires, I'm hoping to create the first steps of a comprehensive abroad guide for BA that can be used (and updated!) by everyone in the years to come.
